# Chat MongoDB Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration of MongoDB for the chat functionality in our Flutter application. The MongoDB integration replaces the in-memory storage that was previously used for storing chat messages and conversations.

## Implementation Details

### MongoDB Models
We have created two MongoDB models for chat functionality:

1. **ChatMessage**
   - Maps to the `chatmessages` collection in MongoDB
   - Stores individual messages with sender, receiver, content, timestamp, etc.
   - Contains indexes for faster querying

2. **ChatConversation**
   - Maps to the `chatconversations` collection in MongoDB
   - Stores conversation metadata including participants, last message, unread count
   - Contains a unique compound index on participants to ensure there's only one conversation between any two users

### Backend Integration
- WebSocket handlers in `server.js` have been updated to use MongoDB for persistence
- Added proper error handling for ObjectId validation
- Implemented conversation tracking with unread message counts
- Created proper REST endpoints in `chatRoutes.js` for HTTP access to chat data

### Flutter App Updates
- Updated the `ChatMessage` model to handle MongoDB document format, including `$date` handling
- Made changes to fix type safety issues in the chat UI components
- Added tests to verify MongoDB document parsing

## Data Flow
1. User sends a message through the Flutter app
2. Message is sent to the server via WebSocket
3. Server saves the message to MongoDB and updates the conversation
4. Server broadcasts the message to the recipient if online
5. When app loads conversations, it queries MongoDB for persistent data

## Benefits
- Chat history persists across server restarts
- Improved query performance with proper indexes
- Ability to implement additional features like message search
- Better scalability for production environments

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination for loading large conversation histories
- Implement message deletion and editing
- Add support for group conversations
- Add read receipts timestamps
